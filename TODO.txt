TODO:
All done! 

DONE:
1. Have a simulation.py that has all the testing code
5. Truncate the scores below 0 and above 100 (right now we have scores that
are above 100)
4. Have a more interesting dataset (see line 24) --> Scipy has get samples from
a binomial distribution
3. Histogram of all the scores before the threshold (we have the histogram of
all the scores AFTER the threshold currently)
