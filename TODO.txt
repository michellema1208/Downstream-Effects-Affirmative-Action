DONE:
1. Have a simulation.py that has all the testing code
5. Truncate the scores below 0 and above 100 (right now we have scores that
are above 100) in noise process
4. Have a more interesting dataset (see line 24) --> Scipy has get samples from
a binomial distribution
3. Histogram of all the scores before the threshold (we have the histogram of
all the scores AFTER the threshold currently)

DONE2:
5. Truncate true types (not just after noise process)
2. Show line for threshold
1. Fix histogram (look at API examples) - more tic marks on x-axis
4. Majority vs minority groups - two different data generations (different parameters - original type distribution)


TODO:
3. Grades - output of a function of their true type (apply another noise process)
  3D plot - or assume that the employer has a threshold for grades having gotten into school
1. Expected true type of admitted people


Discussion:
1. Presentation next Friday?
3. Todo task 1: we made the step 2 so we could read it
4:  Todo task 4: different parameters for min and max when truncating true types?
